                <p>Since starting my career in 2021, I
                have only followed one resource,
                roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go
                from 0 to having a job and changing      
                the financial trajectory of my family.</p>

                <p>I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all
                the internees or junior developers. It's a great
                way to skill up and grow in your career.</p>

            <p>roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
            during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
            repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it
            has had on millions of lives since then.</p>
